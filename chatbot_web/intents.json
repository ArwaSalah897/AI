Here are some common toppings you can use: pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, sausage, peppers, olives, pineapple, anchovies, tomatoes, spinach, garlic. Here's how to make it: Preheat the oven to the desired temperature (usually around 450-500°F or 230-260°C). Roll out your pizza dough to the desired size and thickness. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Add grated mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, spreading it evenly over the surface of the pizza. Add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, sausage, peppers, olives, or any other toppings you like. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove the pizza fromthe oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.",
